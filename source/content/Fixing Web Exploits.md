## Considerations and Overview

Things to note about the exploit code:
- Does it initiate an HTTP or HTTPS connection?
- Does it access a specific web application path or route?
- Does the exploit leverage a pre-authentication vulnerability?
- If not, how does the exploit authenticate to the web application?
- How are the GET or POST requests crafted to trigger and exploit the vulnerability? Is there any HTTP method involved?
- Does it rely on default application settings (such as the web path of the application) that may have been changed after installation?
- Will oddities such as self-signed certificates disrupt the exploit?

Note: public web application exploits do not take into account additional protections (such as .htaccess files or WAF)

## Selecting the Vulnerability and Fixing the Code

1. Find public exploit for the software and version used by the web server
2. Find out the answers to the questions in the above section
3. Fix the original code
	- base url
	- credentials (for post-authentication vuln)
	- web path
	- account for any errors encountered while browsing the target website (e.g. *SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER* error can be fixed by setting `verify=False` parameter for the `requests.post()` function call)
4. Run the exploit and troubleshoot any errors
