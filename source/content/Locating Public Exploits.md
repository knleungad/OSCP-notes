Useful for: penetration testing

> We must carefully read and understand the exploit code before downloading and executing it to prevent endangering the client's system or environment. Alternatively, set up a VM environment with clear snapshots as a testing ground.

## Online Exploit Resources

### [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
- maintained by OffSec
- free archive of public exploits that are gathered through submissions, mailing lists, and public resources
- Fields:
	- D: download exploit
	- A: download the vulnerable application files for testing
	- V: whether the exploit has been verified
	- Title: vulnerable application name, respective vulnerable version and exploit function
	- Type: dos/local/remote/webapp
	- Platform: which kinds of systems are affected by the exploit (can be OS, hardware, code languages)
	- Author: author of the exploit

### [Packet Storm](https://packetstormsecurity.com/)
- up-to-date info on security news, exploits, tools

### [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- online code-hosting platform for version control and collaboration
- anyone can share exploits here
- some exploits on GitHub may be malicious!!

### Google Search Operators
- search: specific software's version + "exploit"
- useful search operators for fine-tuning:
	- inurl
	- intext
	- intitle
- Use extreme caution when using exploits from non-curated resources!

## Offline Exploit Resources

### Exploit Frameworks
a software package that contains reliable exploits for easy execution against a target

- Metasploit (has free community edition and paid pro version)
- Core Impact (no free version)
	- automate testing, link to vulnerability scanners, complete phishing campaigns, and re-test exploited systems to verify remediation
- Canvas 
	- Once the product is paid for, exploits are regularly updated every month
- Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF)7
	- a penetration testing tool focused on client-side attacks executed within a web browser

### SearchSploit
- provided by ExploitDB
- downloadable archived copy of all hosted exploit code
- recommended to update to ensure the latest exploits are included:
  `sudo apt update && sudo apt install exploitdb`
- data stored in `/usr/share/exploitdb/`
	- two major sections (with a csv file for each):
		- `exploits`
		- `shellcodes`
- search exploits using `searchsploit` utility
	- E.g. `searchsploit remote smb microsoft windows`
- Copy exploit into current working directory:
  `searchsploit -m [path or EDB-ID of exploit]`

### Nmap NSE Scripts
- `grep Exploits /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*.nse`
