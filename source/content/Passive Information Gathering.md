	- used to get a rough idea of an organization's web presence
	- e.g. `site:megacorpone.com`
- `filetype:<file type>`: limit results to the specified file type
	- used to find pages supposedly only available to internal network (e.g. php)
	- used to discern what programming languages might be used on a website (e.g. jsp for java server pages, cfm for adobe coldfusion, pl for perl pages)
	- e.g. `site:megacorpone.com filetype:php`
- `-`: exclude item from results
	- used to find interesting (e.g. non-html) pages
	- e.g. `site:megacorpone.com -filetype:html`
- `intitle:<text>`: find pages containing the specified text in the title
	- e.g. `intitle:"index of" "parent directory"` finds pages that contain "index of" in the title and "parent directory" anywhere on the page
